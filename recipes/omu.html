                <li>Vegetable or olive oil

            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Chop up the mushrooms, onions, garlic, and chicken.  I recommend cooking the chicken in the oven a bit, first, with some seasonings (I just use salt, pepper, and some curry powder), so you won’t have to worry about raw chicken.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Heat up some oil in the pan (USE A MEDIUM/SMALL PAN.  A little smaller than the size of your plate is good. This is important for the egg) to medium low.  Once the oil is hot, add the vegetables and the chicken with 2 teaspoons of the ketchup and 2 teaspoons of the soy sauce</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Once the onion becomes clear, add in the rice, and the rest of the ketchup and soy sauce.  Mix everything together.  Once the rice is hot, and thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, put it all in a bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Put a small amount of oil in the pan, and then pour the beaten eggs into the pan.  Lift up the pan and tilt it around in a circle so that the egg covers all sides of the pan.  Let the egg cook, occasionally lifting up the egg from the sides of the pan to make sure it doesn’t stick.  If you can manage it, flip the egg sheet over to cook on the other side.  If you can’t, then just turn the heat down to low and wait for the egg to cook all the way through.  You can try to cook the rice into the omlette before it cooks through, but I find it difficult to transfer to the plate if I do it that way.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Once the egg sheet is cooked, place it onto your plate.  Move it so it is only on one half of the plate (it should be falling off the edge.  Just fold it over or roll that part up for the time being).  Place the rice in the middle of the plate, over a bit of the egg sheet.  Then fold the egg sheet over the top of the rice, and tuck it under the other side of the rice.  Put some ketchup on your finished Omurice</li>
